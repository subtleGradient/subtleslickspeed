Test Definitions. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each framework gets a single [foo]-test.js file, creating a global 'tests' object.
Each key in the object is a test identifier:

window.tests = { "make": function(){ /* satisfy the 'make' test critera */ } };

the sample-tests.js is a skeleton of all available tests with verbal descriptions as to how they should behave.
